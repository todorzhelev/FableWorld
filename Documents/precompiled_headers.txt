Short summary of how to use PCH files in Visual Studio:

- All cpp files in the project have to include stdafx.h (you can change this to something else if you wish)
- Select project in Solution Explorer and in Properties -> C++ -> Precompiled Headers set 'Create/Use precompiled headers' to 'Use'. Hit Apply
- While the Property Pages are still shown select stdafx.cpp in solution explorer and set the value to 'Create'
